      "description": "Using 1,400 credit cards, 600 email addresses, and automated account creation, we ran a $10M startup entirely on free cloud trials. Here's how the house of cards fell when AWS connected the dots.",
      "content": "For two years, our startup ran entirely on free cloud trials. Zero infrastructure costs. We had 1,400 virtual credit cards, 600 email domains, and a Python script that created new AWS accounts faster than they expired. We served 100,000 users without paying a cent for hosting. Then AWS's fraud detection AI had a breakthrough, and our empire collapsed in 4 hours. This is that story.\n\n## The Genesis of the Scam\n\nWe were broke college students with a good idea:\n\n```python\nstartup_status = {\n    'bank_account': 478.32,\n    'monthly_burn': 2000,\n    'infrastructure_needs': {\n        'servers': '20 minimum',\n        'database': 'Multi-region RDS',\n        'storage': '50TB',\n        'cdn': 'Global',\n        'estimated_cost': 15000  # Per month\n    },\n    'options': [\n        'Give up',\n        'Get funding (rejected 47 times)',\n        'Get creative'  # <-- We chose this\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n## The Discovery\n\nAWS Free Tier gives you:\n- 750 hours of t2.micro per month\n- 5GB of S3 storage  \n- 1GB of RDS\n- $300 credits for new accounts\n\n```python\n# The realization\nif new_account == True:\n    free_resources = 'Reset'\n    credits = 300\n    \n# The math\naccounts_needed = infrastructure_cost / 300\n# Result: 50 accounts per month\n\n# The question\ncan_we_automate_this = True  # Yes. Yes we could.\n```\n\n## The Architecture of Fraud\n\n### The Account Factory\n\n```python\nclass AccountFactory:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.email_domains = self.buy_domains()  # 600 domains at $1 each\n        self.virtual_cards = self.setup_privacy_cards()  # Privacy.com API\n        self.phone_numbers = self.buy_voip_numbers()  # Twilio\n        self.addresses = self.generate_addresses()  # Real but variations\n        \n    def create_aws_account(self):\n        email = f\"{uuid4()}@{random.choice(self.email_domains)}\"\n        card = self.virtual_cards.create_card(limit=1)  # $1 limit\n        phone = self.phone_numbers.get_available()\n        \n        account = {\n            'email': email,\n            'card': card,\n            'phone': phone,\n            'name': self.generate_realistic_name(),\n            'company': self.generate_company_name(),\n            'address': self.shuffle_address_components()\n        }\n        \n        # Selenium automation to sign up\n        return self.automate_signup(account)\n```\n\n### The Orchestration Layer\n\n```python\nclass FreeTrialOrchestrator:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.active_accounts = []\n        self.expiring_soon = []\n        self.burnt_accounts = []  # RIP\n        \n    def maintain_infrastructure(self):\n        while company_exists:\n            # Check account health\n            for account in self.active_accounts:\n                if account.days_remaining < 3:\n                    self.migrate_workload(account)\n                    self.expiring_soon.append(account)\n            \n            # Spawn new accounts\n            while len(self.active_accounts) < 50:\n                new_account = AccountFactory().create_aws_account()\n                self.active_accounts.append(new_account)\n                \n            # The great migration\n            if len(self.expiring_soon) > 5:\n                self.execute_migration()\n```\n\n## The Monthly Dance\n\n```python\n# Every 30 days, we did this:\nmigration_procedure = {\n    'day_25': 'Create 50 new AWS accounts',\n    'day_26': 'Provision infrastructure on new accounts',\n    'day_27': 'Test everything works',\n    'day_28': 'Migrate all data (50TB...)',\n    'day_29': 'Update DNS to point to new infra',\n    'day_30': 'Delete old accounts',\n    'day_1': 'Breathe',\n    'cost': 0\n}\n\n# The migration script\nasync def monthly_migration():\n    # Create new infrastructure\n    new_accounts = await create_accounts_batch(50)\n    new_infra = await provision_infrastructure(new_accounts)\n    \n    # The scariest part\n    await migrate_database(old_rds, new_rds)  # 8 hours of terror\n    await sync_s3_buckets(old_s3, new_s3)  # 50TB transfer\n    await update_load_balancers(new_targets)\n    await update_route53(new_endpoints)\n    \n    # Pray nothing broke\n    await health_check()\n    \n    # Burn the evidence\n    for account in old_accounts:\n        account.delete()  # Good luck finding us\n```\n\n## The Close Calls\n\n### The Verification Challenge\n```python\n# Month 3: AWS wanted phone verification\naws_support: \"Please verify your phone number\"\nus: \"*buys 100 Twilio numbers*\"\n\n# Month 8: AWS wanted business documents  \naws_support: \"Please provide business registration\"\nus: \"*generates 50 Delaware LLCs for $50 each*\"\n\n# Month 14: AWS wanted tax information\naws_support: \"Please provide EIN\"\nus: \"*applies for 50 EINs online (free)*\"\n\n# We always had an answer\n```\n\n### The IP Address Problem\n```python\n# AWS started noticing all accounts came from same IP\nsolution = {\n    'service': 'Residential proxy network',\n    'cost': '$500/month',  # Our only real expense\n    'ips': 10000,\n    'countries': 50\n}\n\n# Each account signup came from different:\n- IP address\n- Browser fingerprint  \n- Timezone\n- Language settings\n- Screen resolution\n\n# We were ghosts\n```\n\n## Year 2: Industrial Scale\n\n```python\nscale_metrics = {\n    'active_aws_accounts': 147,\n    'active_gcp_accounts': 89,\n    'active_azure_accounts': 63,\n    'monthly_migrations': 3,  #

We served real users, solved real problems, and built real value. We also committed wire fraud, violated terms of service 1,400 times, and nearly went to prison.\n\nWas it worth it? We have a legitimate business now. 100,000 users still rely on us. We employ 35 people. We pay our bills (all of them, to everyone, especially AWS).\n\nBut I still check over my shoulder for AWS lawyers.\n\nAnd I can never use the free tier again. Ever. They know my DNA pattern by now.\n\n*Legal note: This story is mostly fictional. Mostly. Don't try this. AWS will find you. They found us. They find everyone. Pay for your infrastructure.

By an intern. Using 3 spaces.\n\nWe don't talk about that either.\n\nThe office dog went to therapy. It's doing better now.\n\nSometimes, late at night, I wonder what would have happened if I'd just fixed the SQL injection and ignored the indentation.\n\nProbably would have found something else to fight about.\n\nEngineers are like that.\n\n*P.S. - Tabs are still superior. Come at me.*\n\n*P.P.S. - That was a joke. Please. No more wars. I'm tired.*",

They developed personalities, reputations, and followers. They changed how people ate, where they went, what restaurants cooked.\n\nJennifer L. doesn't exist. But tell that to the thousand restaurants that thanked her.\n\nOr the million people who trusted her.\n\nShe was fake. But her impact was real.\n\nThat's the paradox we're paying for.\n\nLiterally. For the next 200 years.\n\n*P.S. - If you see a review from Jennifer L., it's not us. Probably. We deleted everything. Except... no, we definitely deleted everything. Don't check.*",

I solved problems so thoroughly that people forgot problems existed. I made the complex simple, the slow fast, and the expensive cheap.\n\nAnd in doing so, I made myself unnecessary.\n\nBut here's the thing: I'm now making 3x more as a consultant, working half the hours, fixing the same problems at different companies.\n\nThe real optimization was optimizing my career.\n\nJust took an unexpected path to get there.\n\n*P.S. - To any DBAs reading this: Leave some queries slightly broken. It's called job security. You're welcome.*\n\n*P.P.S. - That was a joke. Or was it? Check your query performance. If everything's perfect, update your resume.*",

Dave was right to leave it\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\n1. **Bugs become features over time**\n2. **14 years is long enough for a bug to become law**\n3. **Two wrongs can make a right in production**\n4. **Breaking changes include fixing things**\n5. **Compatibility is more important than correctness**\n6. **Some bugs are load-bearing**\n7. **Dave knew what he was doing by not fixing it**\n\n## Philosophical Conclusion\n\nIs math wrong if everyone agrees to use the wrong version? If a bug exists long enough, does it become the truth? We've created a financial system where 2+2=5, and now it's too late to correct it.\n\nThe bug is dead. Long live the bug.\n\n*P.S. - We found 38 more bugs while investigating this one. We're not fixing any of them. They're all features now. Dave was right about everything.*\n\n*P.P.S. - If you're Dave and reading this, please don't come back. We can't afford to fix anything else you left behind.*",
