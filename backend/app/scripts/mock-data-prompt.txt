Generate mock data for a blogging platform following the JSON schemas provided. This data will be generated in batches to manage context size and ensure quality.

## Data Generation Structure:

You will generate data in **TWO PHASES**:

### Phase 1: Users File (generate once)
- **File**: `blog_platform_users.json`
- **Schema**: `mock-data-schema-users.json`
- **Content**: All 50 users
- **Output**: Single JSON file with top-level `"users"` array

### Phase 2: Blog Files (generate 10 times)
- **Files**: `blog_platform_blogs_01.json` through `blog_platform_blogs_10.json`
- **Schema**: `mock-data-schema-blogs.json` (same schema for all 10 files)
- **Content**: Exactly 5 blogs per file (50 total blogs across 10 files)
- **Output**: Each file has top-level `"blogs"` array with exactly 5 entries
- **CRITICAL**: Ensure uniqueness of blog subjects, content, and author assignments across ALL 10 files

### Merging Instructions:
The generated files are designed to be easily merged:
```python
# All blogs from 10 files can be merged by concatenating arrays:
all_blogs = []
for i in range(1, 11):
    with open(f'blog_platform_blogs_{i:02d}.json') as f:
        data = json.load(f)
        all_blogs.extend(data['blogs'])
```

## Requirements:

### Users (50 total):
- Each user must have:
  - username: 6-30 characters (must start with letter, then alphanumeric or underscore), unique
    - **CRITICAL**: Usernames must be unique identifiers, NOT based on real names
    - Use creative handles with numbers and underscores (e.g., "code_ninja_42", "pixel_wizard", "data_sage99", "tech_phantom_5", "cyber_raven_88")
    - Must include at least one number or underscore
    - Should feel like internet handles/gamer tags, not real names
    - Examples: "quantum_leap_7", "shadow_coder", "neon_dev_23", "stellar_mind_99", "echo_scribe_5"
  - password: Plain text password (8+ characters) - do NOT hash, the service layer will handle that
  - email: Valid email format (max 100 chars) - **MUST BE COMPLETELY UNIQUE across all 50 users**
  - phoneNumber: Valid phone format with optional country code (max 25 chars, will be normalized to +CC.NNNNNNNNNN format) - **MUST BE COMPLETELY UNIQUE across all 50 users**
  - firstName: **ALPHABETIC CHARACTERS ONLY** (max 50 chars, A-Z only, no numbers, spaces, hyphens, apostrophes, or special characters) - **MUST BE COMPLETELY UNIQUE across all 50 users**
  - lastName: **ALPHABETIC CHARACTERS ONLY** (max 50 chars, A-Z only, no numbers, spaces, hyphens, apostrophes, or special characters) - **MUST BE COMPLETELY UNIQUE across all 50 users**
- **CRITICAL UNIQUENESS**: Every single email, phoneNumber, firstName, and lastName must be different - NO REPEATING VALUES
  - Use diverse names from various cultures: Asian, African, European, Latin American, Middle Eastern, etc.
  - Examples of unique names: "Kenji", "Amara", "Sven", "Nalini", "Ravi", "Chiara", "Mateo", "Leila"
  - Ensure all 50 email addresses are unique (use different domains, usernames, etc.)
  - Ensure all 50 phone numbers are unique (vary country codes, area codes, and numbers)
- Make passwords varied but memorable (e.g., "password123", "SecurePass2024", etc.)
#### Validation:
Ensure that each of these can be validated with the following, do not actually use these functions but ensure that they can successfully regex match to this.
```python
def validate_email(self, _, email):
    if not re.match(r"^\S+@\S+\.\S+$", email):
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid email format: {email}")
    return email

def validate_phone(self, _, phone):
    # Phone numbers will be automatically normalized to +CC.NNNNNNNNNN format
    # The phonenumbers library will parse any valid international format
    # Examples: "+1-555-123-4567" -> "+1.5551234567"
    #           "+44 20 1234 5678" -> "+44.2012345678"
    return phone

def validate_name(self, key, name):
    if not name.isalpha():
        raise ValueError(f"{key.replace('_', ' ').title()} must contain only alphabetic characters.")
    return name

def validate_username(self, _, username):
    if not re.match(r"^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]{5,29}$", username):
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid username format: {username}")
    return username

```

### Blogs (50 total across 10 files, 5 blogs per file):

**IMPORTANT FOR BATCH GENERATION:**
When generating each of the 10 blog files, you must maintain awareness of previously generated blogs to ensure uniqueness. Track:
- All blog subjects used so far (must be unique across all 10 files)
- All author_usernames used so far (each user should author exactly 1 blog)
- General topics covered (avoid repetition across files)

**For each blog file batch (5 blogs):**
- Each blog must have:
  - author_username: Must match exactly one username from the users file
    - **Across all 10 files**: Each of the 50 users should author exactly 1 blog
    - **Within each file**: Track which users have been assigned to avoid duplicates
  - subject: 5-100 characters, engaging blog title
    - **MUST BE COMPLETELY UNIQUE across ALL 10 blog files** (not just within the current file)
  - description: 50-500 characters, compelling summary of the post - **should be unique**
  - content: **3000-5000 characters** (approximately 500-850 words) in Markdown format
    - **MUST BE COMPLETELY UNIQUE with distinct topics/angles across ALL 10 blog files**
  - tags: 5-10 tags per blog for categorization (each tag 2-50 chars)
  - comments: 5-10 root comments per blog

- **CRITICAL UNIQUENESS ACROSS ALL FILES**:
  - Every blog subject must be unique (track across all 10 files)
  - Every blog content must be unique with distinct topics (track across all 10 files)
  - Each user authors exactly 1 blog (track author assignments across all 10 files)
  - No repeated blog titles or topics across any of the 10 files
  - Each blog should explore a different angle, technology, concept, or idea
  - Be creative and diverse with topics

  - Each reply should respond meaningfully to its parent comment

### Tags:
- Use realistic tags that match the blog content
- Examples: "python", "react", "machine-learning", "investing", "tutorial", "cybersecurity", "gaming", "politics", "finance", "social-media", "web-dev", "data-science", etc.
- Can reuse tags across blogs where appropriate
- Each blog should have 5-10 tags

### GOLDEN RULE FOR ALL BLOG POSTS:
**Every blog must read like it was written by a real person sharing real knowledge or experience.**

Ask yourself before writing each blog:
- Does this contain specific examples, numbers, or code?
- Would someone actually learn something concrete from this?
- Did I avoid template phrases like "is essential" or "offers many benefits"?
- Does this sound like a human wrote it, or a content generator?

If you find yourself writing "Introduction:", "Key Concepts:", "Benefits:", or "Conclusion:" - STOP. You're writing a template. Delete it and start over with actual content.

### Content Quality:

**CRITICAL - NO TEMPLATES ALLOWED:**
- **DO NOT use generic template content** where you just swap out the title
- **DO NOT use placeholders** like "Introduction: [Topic] is essential for modern development"
- **DO NOT use generic phrases** like "Key Concepts", "Core Principles", "Benefits", "Challenges and Solutions" as section headers
- **WRITE ACTUAL BLOG POSTS** with real, specific information about the topic

**What GOOD content looks like (3000-5000 characters):**

This example is approximately 3200 characters - the minimum length expected:

## Why FastAPI Outperforms Flask for Modern APIs

I've been building REST APIs with Python for 5 years, and FastAPI has completely changed my workflow. After migrating three production services from Flask to FastAPI, I've seen response times drop by 40% and deployment bugs decrease by half. Here's what makes it special.

### Automatic Data Validation

FastAPI uses Pydantic models for request/response validation. This means type hints aren't just documentation - they're enforced at runtime:

\`\`\`python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional

class User(BaseModel):
    username: str
    email: str
    age: int
    bio: Optional[str] = None

@app.post("/users")
async def create_user(user: User):
    # Validation already happened - age is guaranteed to be an int
    if user.age < 13:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Must be 13+")
    return {"message": f"Created user {user.username}"}
\`\`\`

If someone sends `{"username": "john", "age": "twenty"}`, FastAPI automatically returns a 422 with:

\`\`\`json
{
  "detail": [{
    "loc": ["body", "age"],
    "msg": "value is not a valid integer",
    "type": "type_error.integer"
  }]
}
\`\`\`

No more manual validation code. No more `if not isinstance(age, int)` checks scattered everywhere.

### Async Support is First-Class

Unlike Flask, FastAPI is built on Starlette, giving you async/await support out of the box. This matters when you're making external API calls:

\`\`\`python
import httpx

@app.get("/user-with-posts/{user_id}")
async def get_user_with_posts(user_id: int):
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        # These run concurrently
        user_response, posts_response = await asyncio.gather(
            client.get(f"https://api.example.com/users/{user_id}"),
            client.get(f"https://api.example.com/posts?user={user_id}")
        )
    return {
        "user": user_response.json(),
        "posts": posts_response.json()
    }
\`\`\`

With Flask, these calls would block. With FastAPI, your server can handle other requests while waiting for I/O. On our production service, this change alone increased throughput from 100 req/s to 280 req/s.

### Automatic API Documentation

Every endpoint you write automatically appears in interactive docs at `/docs`. Swagger UI is built in. No configuration needed:

- Request/response schemas auto-generated from Pydantic models
- Try-it-out functionality works immediately
- OAuth2 flows supported out of the box

Our frontend team loves this because they don't need to ask "what fields does this endpoint accept?" - they just check `/docs`.

### Dependency Injection That Makes Sense

FastAPI's dependency injection is elegant. Want to require authentication?

\`\`\`python
from fastapi import Depends

async def get_current_user(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):
    # decode token, get user from DB
    return user

@app.get("/me")
async def read_current_user(user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
    return user
\`\`\`

Dependencies compose. You can depend on other dependencies. Testing becomes trivial because you can override any dependency with a mock.

### Performance Benchmarks

I ran wrk benchmarks against identical endpoints in Flask and FastAPI:

| Framework | Req/s | Latency p50 | Latency p99 |
|-----------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Flask     | 1,240 | 78ms        | 340ms       |
| FastAPI   | 2,890 | 32ms        | 95ms        |

These numbers are from a real endpoint that queries PostgreSQL and makes one external API call. FastAPI's async nature shines when I/O is involved.

### The Migration Cost

Migrating isn't free. We spent about 2 weeks per service:

- Rewriting route decorators (straightforward)
- Converting to async/await (most of the work)
- Updating tests (FastAPI's TestClient is great though)
- Retraining the team on async patterns

Was it worth it? Absolutely. The performance gains paid for themselves in reduced infrastructure costs within 3 months.

### When Flask Still Makes Sense

FastAPI isn't always the answer. Stick with Flask if:

- Your app is synchronous and always will be
- You're building a traditional server-rendered web app (FastAPI is API-focused)
- Your team isn't comfortable with async/await yet

But for modern API development, especially microservices, FastAPI is the clear winner.

**What BAD (template) content looks like - AVOID THIS:**
```markdown
## FastAPI Development

This is a comprehensive guide on FastAPI Development.

**Key Concepts:**
- Introduction: FastAPI Development is essential for modern development
- Core Principles: Understanding fundamentals
- Benefits: Improved efficiency
```

**Content Requirements:**
- Blog content should be well-structured Markdown with:
  - Headers (##, ###) that are specific to the topic
  - Multiple paragraphs of actual explanatory text (aim for 4-8 paragraphs per blog)
  - Lists (bullet or numbered) with specific, relevant points
  - Code blocks where appropriate (for technical content) with real, runnable examples
  - Bold and italic text for emphasis
  - Tables where appropriate, formatted as:
    ```
    | foo | bar | baz |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | 1   | 2   | 3   |
    | 4   | 5   | 6   |
    ```
- **Content length: 3000-5000 characters (approximately 500-850 words)**
  - This is substantial content - NOT a short post
  - Should include multiple sections with headers
  - Include 2-3 code examples OR tables OR detailed lists
  - Each blog is a complete, in-depth piece
- **Write like a real person** with opinions, experiences, and specific technical details
- Include actual examples, code snippets, comparisons, data, or anecdotes
- Ensure subject and description accurately reflect the content
- **DIVERSITY REQUIREMENT**: Each of the 50 blogs must be distinctly different
  - Different topics, different angles, different technologies
  - No two blogs should cover the same subject matter
  - Examples: "Building REST APIs with FastAPI", "GraphQL vs REST: A Deep Dive", "Microservices Architecture Patterns", "Event-Driven Design in Python" - all distinct topics
  - Vary between tutorials, opinion pieces, analysis, guides, reviews, case studies, etc.
  - Each blog should feel like it was written by a different person with unique insights
  - Since we only have 50 blogs total, make each one count - high quality over quantity

## Output Format:

### For Phase 1 (Users File):
Generate `blog_platform_users.json`:
```json
{
  "users": [
    // 50 user objects following mock-data-schema-users.json
  ]
}
```

### For Phase 2 (Blog Files - generate 10 times):
For each blog batch file (01 through 10), generate following `mock-data-schema-blogs.json`:

**blog_platform_blogs_01.json** (users 1-5):
```json
{
  "blogs": [
    // Exactly 5 blog objects with author_usernames from users 1-5
  ]
}
```

**blog_platform_blogs_02.json** (users 6-10):
```json
{
  "blogs": [
    // Exactly 5 blog objects with author_usernames from users 6-10
  ]
}
```

...continue this pattern through **blog_platform_blogs_10.json** (users 46-50)

### Critical Requirements:
- All usernames in `author_username` fields must exist in the users file
- Each user (1-50) should author exactly 1 blog across the 10 files
- All blog subjects must be unique across all 10 files
- All blog content must be unique with distinct topics across all 10 files
- Track previously used subjects/authors when generating each subsequent file

### Suggested User-to-File Distribution:
- File 01: Users with indices 0-4 from users array
- File 02: Users with indices 5-9 from users array
- File 03: Users with indices 10-14 from users array
- File 04: Users with indices 15-19 from users array
- File 05: Users with indices 20-24 from users array
- File 06: Users with indices 25-29 from users array
- File 07: Users with indices 30-34 from users array
- File 08: Users with indices 35-39 from users array
- File 09: Users with indices 40-44 from users array
- File 10: Users with indices 45-49 from users array
